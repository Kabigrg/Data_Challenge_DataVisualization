# Our group project focuses on the application of ARIMA modeling techniques to predict future trends
in a time series dataset. ARIMA, which stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, is a
powerful tool for time series forecasting widely used in various fields such as finance, economics,
and demand forecasting. Major companies like Pitney and Bowes use this model to train data on a
daily basis and to guide the business strategy team to make important decisions.
We gained practical experience in time series analysis and forecasting and also got to develop data
analysis and modeling skills applicable in various domains. We learned to collaborate effectively
within a group setting, emphasizing teamwork and division of tasks
